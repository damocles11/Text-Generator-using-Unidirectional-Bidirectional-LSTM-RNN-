"['The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-', 'This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.', 'CONS (Ranked) -', '1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.', ""2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later."", ""3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must."", ""4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen."", '5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.', 'P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.', 'PROS (Ranked) -', '1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.', '2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.', '3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.', '4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.', '5. Great screen.', '6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.', '7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.', ""P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc.."", 'All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.', '4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY']",['Reviewed in India on 4 November 2018'],['35 people found this helpful'],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],NEVER SETTLE?
