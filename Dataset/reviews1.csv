"[""Just got mine last week for 33k. And now they are launching one plus 7 for 33k which has d latest processor, better screen, speaker and finger print sensor. Amazon has been really unfair by selling 6t at 33k. Please don't go for 6t. They just want to clear the stocks. Wait for a while you will get this more a more cheaper price.

"[""Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone.""]",['Reviewed in India on 4 November 2018'],['18 people found this helpful'],['4.0 out of 5 stars'],Overall phone is recommendable

"['I am a big fan of Apple. Have been using Iphone from last 5 years. Wanted to change the phone to the new one. But not much of Innovation from Apple. So, I switched to Oneplus and Oneplus 6T was a best replacement.', 'The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.', 'Design: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The color is amazing - Mirror Black. The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable. When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean!', ""Battery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it."", ""Camera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present."", 'Sound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone.', 'While you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the OnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger, thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with better longevity is it really a loss?', 'The headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an adapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same footprint otherwise.']",['Reviewed in India on 30 December 2018'],['15 people found this helpful'],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],Great Phone.

"['They are exactly Working on their tag line ""the speed you need"". It\'s very fast. Very very fast. Talking about camera, that would have been better than op6. But nothing changed. Night scape is very good change. You can feel the light in nightscape mode. Audio is better than most of smartphones but not up to One plus mark. Battery life is best. You can rely on his battery for only one charge of half an hour with full day battery life even if you use it fully. Fingerprint scanner can\'t be better. New update help him open fast. If you have budget of 35k, buy it without second thought.']",['Reviewed in India on 6 November 2018'],['15 people found this helpful'],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],The speed you need.

"[""Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also."", ""Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER)."", ""Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera."", 'Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.', ""I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good.
