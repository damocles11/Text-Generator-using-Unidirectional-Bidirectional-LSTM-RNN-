But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.', '1-  battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.', '2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.', ""3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue."", '4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed  in 20k phone easily.', '5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.', 'Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and', '2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.', ""If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone."", 'I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good.

"['Overall: 8/10:', ""A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)"", 'Unboxing & contents: 8/10', 'One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.', 'First Impressions: 9/10', 'The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.', 'Setup: 8/10', 'The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.', 'Battery: 7/10', 'The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.', 'Performance: 9/10', 'Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.', 'Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.', 'Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.', 'Hope this helps!']",['Reviewed in India on 8 April 2019'],['11 people found this helpful'],['4.0 out of 5 stars'],Amazing performance without breaking the bank!
"['Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.', 'Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the ""BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE"" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven\'t received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself.']",['Reviewed in India on 4 November 2018'],['13 people found this helpful'],['2.0 out of 5 stars'],Phone functions are nice but battery is dying very rapidly

"['DESIGN:', 'If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.', 'Visible differences between 6 & 6T:', 'Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.', 'Technical advancement:', 'Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.', 'CAMERA:', 'I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.', 'BATTERY:', 'Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !', 'SPEAKERS:', 'External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.', 'SECURITY:', 'Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes.']",['Reviewed in India on 11 November 2018'],['14 people found this helpful'],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],Value for money and a treat to have
